# ðŸ¥¦ Vegetable Image Classification

A computer vision project that classifies vegetable images into their respective categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  
This project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook as part of an AI/computer vision learning journey.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a classification model that can identify different types of vegetables from images.  
The dataset is preprocessed, resized, and used to train a model that can predict the vegetable category with good accuracy.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Automatic image preprocessing (resizing, encoding, splitting).  
- Support for multi-class vegetable classification.  
- Easy-to-train pipeline with clear steps.  
- Can be extended with advanced models (CNN, transfer learning).
